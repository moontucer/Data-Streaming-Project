![1698196520888](image/README/1698196520888.png)

## Description

I used Airflow, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Spark and Cassandra in order to establish a fully automated ETL pipeline in a container runtime, with a CI using GitHub Actions to automate the service's Docker image updates on DockerHub.

## Get Started

- Clone the repository
  - `git clone https://github.com/moontucer/Data-Streaming-Project/`
- Go to the project folder
  - `cd Data-Streaming-Project`
- Build the environment with Docker Compose
  - `docker-compose up`
